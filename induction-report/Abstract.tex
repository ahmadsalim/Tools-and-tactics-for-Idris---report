Idris is a dependently-typed programming language with support for tactics-based theorem proving. This report outlines my work on
understanding what dependently typed languages are, how it is possible to do proves using tactics and finally implement a tactic that
allows proofs by induction myself.
The induction tactic is based on eliminators, which represent a logic-based approach to computation using an inductive data-type with some similarities to pattern matching
in the programming world.

The work resulted in an algorithm for generating eliminators which supported all various kinds of inductive data-structures, except inductive-recursive ones. An induction
tactic based on the eliminators was created successfully, albeit with minor limitations that should be easily solvable in the future.

The following pull requests signifies my work on eliminators and the induction tactic: \url{https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/pull/673} and \url{https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/pull/713}.
