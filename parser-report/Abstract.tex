Idris has already a Parsec-based parser, but errors are uninformative and highly inaccurate. Furthermore, the language lacks a formal grammar
and as a consequence suffers from many inconsistencies.

This report details my work on formalizing the grammar of Idris and porting the parser to Trifecta such that error messages are improved,
the syntax is more consistent and source code location tracking is accurate.
The work had showed great improvements especially regarding error messages, has been well-received
by the community and is now the sole official parser.

The majority of my work is represented by the following pull requests: \url{https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/pull/492},
\url{https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/pull/497} and \url{https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/pull/506}.
